  <h2>Project 1: Huffman Coding</h2>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> is a data compression scheme that is used in many popular data formats, including zipfiles (most of which use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE">DEFLATE</a> format, incorporating Huffman coding and other techniques) and MP3 (which uses Huffman coding near the end of a < href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2007/10/the-audiofile-understanding-mp3-compression/3/">fairly complicated encoding process</>).</p>

  <p>What does "data compression" mean? It's the idea that a lot of the information we exchange contains some degree of "redundancy," so it takes up more space to store (or more time to transmit) than absolutely necessary. One quick (but highly imperfect) scheme for compressing English is smply t rmv ll th vwls. Note that while a compressed word like "t" could come from "it", "at," "to," and maybe more, the context makes it pretty clear what it should be. That's redundancy in action.</p>

  <p>Huffman coding can be applied any set of "symbols," and relies on the idea that the <i>most frequent</i> symbols should have the <i>shortest</i> representation. (In contrast, remember that the ASCII system for the symbols used on US keyboards uses 7 bits to represent every character, whether it's a super-common character like 'e' or a pretty rare one like '~'.) Of course, if we don't really know much about symbol frequency, or if every symbol is equally common, then Huffman coding can't really help us.
